# Bank Account Simulator
This project simulates a bank account creation from a bank using OOP concepts
such as inheritance where baank objects inherit from the Bank Class.

## How it works
A bank object is created from the bank class which then creates and manages bank account objects 
and allows operations to be performed between accounts.
