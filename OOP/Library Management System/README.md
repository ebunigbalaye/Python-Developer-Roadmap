# Library Management System
A simple system that allows users to add,borrow and returns books to the library.
It also allows users to view the books in the library and their availability.

## How it works
This Script uses the principles of Object Oriented Programming to effectively and neatly 
manage the books in a library. The library object maintains and keeps track of all the book objects created from the Book class in the library. It also creates book objects and stores them.
